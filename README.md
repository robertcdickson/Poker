# Poker
This repo contains python code to work with poker data. A basic poker game is implemented which can be used to run simulated games. The PokerStarsCollection class allows for workling with pokerstars
output files which can then be passed to the poker game to simulate real game scenarios.

# PokerStarsCollection Module
The PokerStarsCollection module contains two classes, `PokerStarsCollection` and
`PokerGame`. The `PokerStarsCollection` Object assimilates a whole poker 
session consisting of individual `PokerStarGame` objects.
